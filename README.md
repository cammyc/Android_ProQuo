Android_ProQuo is the repository for Android app BeLive.

BeLive is a new channel in which tickets can be sold between people for events that are only in their area. 
Our smartphone application utilizes the location of our customers to create a unique online marketplace of tickets that can tend to the userâ€™s needs. 
It provides a simple platform in which users can either request a specific ticket to an upcoming event and be contacted by a nearby seller, or post a ticket and have customers contact them to acquire the ticket. 
BeLive optimizes the exposure of your advertised or requested ticket. By posting a physical representation of your ticket on the map your ticket will not get lost in a sea of posts. 

BeLive builds a community of local ticket sellers and requesters in which people can sell their ticket to exclusive events found in one's own city, town, or university. Now events such as college sports, comedy clubs, and local concerts will have a medium in which they can sell or request their tickets to/from fellow students or townspeople. BeLive technology, such as in-app transactions, allows users to seamlessly buy and sell their tickets within seconds.
